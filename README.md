ChatGPT: Calculator Program

The calculator is a simple, interactive, and responsive tool that performs basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It was created as a demonstration of my front-end development skills using:

- HTML5 for structure
- CSS3 for styling and layout

You can find the project code in the `calculator.html`, `calculator.css`, and `calculator.js` files.
