            Hi there! I'm <strong>Nkosi Abram Mjoli</strong>, a passionate and driven web developer with a keen interest in creating intuitive, visually appealing, and responsive websites. With a strong foundation in <em>HTML</em>, <em>CSS3</em>, <em>JavaScript</em>, and <em>UI/UX design</em>, I have acquired the necessary skills to build seamless, user-friendly web applications. 

I hold a <em>Front-End Development Certificate</em>, which has equipped me with the technical expertise and creative mindset to tackle complex projects from concept to completion. I love crafting aesthetically pleasing interfaces and ensuring that the user experience is smooth and engaging. My goal is to build websites that are not only functional but also accessible, responsive, and user-centered. 

Whether it’s designing a clean and modern layout or implementing dynamic features with JavaScript, I’m always eager to learn new techniques and tools to improve my craft. I’m excited to continue growing as a developer, and I’m always open to working on projects that challenge me and allow me to make a positive impact on the web. 

Feel free to check out my work below and reach out if you'd like to collaborate or learn more about what I do!
